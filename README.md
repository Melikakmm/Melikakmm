# ðŸ‘‹ HELLO, I AM MELIKA ....


- ðŸ”­ Presently, I am engaged in a one-year research endeavor at the University of Padova, focusing on the integration of Artificial Intelligence techniques with disordered protein structures. Additionally, I am conducting a scaling ansatz analysis on droplet size distributions within protein condensates as part of this research pursuit.

- âš¡ Alongside my background in **theoretical physics**, and **mathematics**, I have received comprehensive training in various aspects of computation, including **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **data analysis**, **data management**, and **distributed computing**.
