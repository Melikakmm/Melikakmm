## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Presently, I am engaged in a one-year research endeavor at the University of Padova, focusing on the integration of Artificial Intelligence techniques with disordered protein structures. Additionally, I am conducting a scaling ansatz analysis on droplet size distributions within protein condensates as part of this research pursuit.

- âš¡ Alongside my background in **theoretical physics**, and **mathematics**, I have received comprehensive training in various aspects of computation, including **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **data analysis**, **data management**, and **distributed computing**.

My most important projects:

1. **My research projects**: The GitHub repositories associated with these projects are presently set to private access. This confidentiality has been implemented at the team's request, primarily in anticipation of forthcoming publications.
 
2. **My master's thesis**:
3. **Gaussian Regression interatomic potentials**:
4. **Graph Neural Network for Frustration index**:(still ongoing)
5. **Audio classification**:
6. **Cython/Python wrapper for SEVN**:
7. **Low-Mass-X-ray-Binaries**:
8. **Volatility-carry-trading-strategy**:
